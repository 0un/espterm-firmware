		<ul>
			<li>*Communication UART (Rx, Tx)* can be configured in the <a href="<?= url('cfg_system') ?>">System Settings</a>.

			<li>*Boot log and debug messages* are available on pin *GPIO2* (P2) at 115200\,baud, 1 stop bit, no parity.
				Those messages may be disabled through compile flags.

			<li>*Loopback test*: Connect the Rx and Tx pins with a piece of wire. Anything you type in the browser should
				appear on the screen. Set _Parser Timeout = 0_ in <a href="<?= url('cfg_term') ?>">Terminal Settings</a>
				to be able to manually enter escape sequences.

			<li>There is very little RAM available to the webserver, and it can support at most 4 connections at the same time.
				Each terminal session (open window with the terminal screen) uses one persistent connection for screen updates.
				*Avoid leaving unused windows open*, or either the RAM or connections may be exhausted.

			<li>*For best performance*, use the module in Client mode (connected to external network) and minimize the number
				of simultaneous connections. Enabling AP consumes extra RAM because the DHCP server and Captive Portal
				DNS server are started.

			<li>In AP mode, *check that the WiFi channel used is clear*; interference may cause flaky connection.
				A good mobile app to use for this is
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer">WiFi Analyzer (Google Play)</a>.
				Adjust the hotspot strength and range using the _Tx Power setting_.

			<li>Hold the BOOT button (GPIO0 to GND) for ~1 second to force enable AP. Hold it for ~6 seconds to restore default settings.
				(This is indicated by the blue LED rapidly flashing). Default settings can be overwritten in the
				<a href="<?= url('cfg_system') ?>">System Settings</a>.

	<h2>Basic Intro & Nomenclature</h2>

	<div class="Row v">
		<img src="/img/vt100.jpg" class="aside" alt="VT102">

		<p>
			ESPTerm emulates VT102 (pictured) with some additions from later VT models and Xterm.
			All commonly used attributes and commands are supported.
			ESPTerm is capable of displaying ncurses applications such as _Midnight Commander_ using _agetty_.
		</p>

		<p>
			ESPTerm accepts UTF-8 characters received on the communication UART and displays them on the screen,
			interpreting some codes as Control Characters. Those are e.g. _Carriage Return_ (13), _Line Feed_ (10),
			_Tab_ (9), _Backspace_ (8) and _Bell_ (7).
		</p>

		<p>
			Escape sequences start with the control character _ESC_ (27),
			followed by any number of ASCII characters forming the body of the command.
		</p>

		<h3>Nomenclature & Command Types</h3>

			Screen updates are sent to the browser through a WebSocket after some time of inactivity on the communication UART
			(called "Redraw Delay"). After an update is sent, at least a time of "Redraw Cooldown" must elapse before the next
			update can be sent. Those delays are used is to avoid burdening the server with tiny updates during a large screen
			repaint. If you experience issues (broken image due to dropped bytes), try adjusting those config options. It may also

		<h3>Action buttons</h3>

		<p>
			The blue buttons under the screen send ASCII codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which incidentally
			correspond to _Ctrl+A,B,C,D,E_. This choice was made to make button press parsing as simple as possible.
		</p>

		<h3>Mouse</h3>

		<p>
			ESPTerm implements standard mouse tracking modes based on Xterm. Mouse tracking can be used to implement
			powerful user interactions such as on-screen buttons, draggable sliders or dials, menus etc. ESPTerm's
			mouse tracking was tested using VTTest and should be compatible with all terminal applications
			that request mouse tracking.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mouse can be tracked in different ways; some are easier to parse, others more powerful. The coordinates
			can also be encoded in different ways. All mouse tracking options are set using option commands:
			`CSI ? _n_ h` to enable, `CSI ? _n_ l` to disable option _n_.
		</p>

		<h4>Mouse Tracking Modes</h4>

		<p>
			All tracking modes produce three numbers which are then encoded and send to the application.
			First is the _event number_ N, then the _X and Y coordinates_, 1-based.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mouse buttons are numbered: 1=left, 2=middle, 3=right.
			Wheel works as two buttons (4 and 5) which generate only press events (no release).
		</p>

		<div class="tscroll">
		<table class="nomen">
			<thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
			<tr>
				<td>`9`</td>
				<td>*X10~mode*</td>
				<td>
					This is the most basic tracking mode, in which <b>only button presses</b> are reported.
					N = button - 1: (0 left, 1 middle, 2 right, 3, 4 wheel).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1000`</td>
				<td>*Normal~mode*</td>
				<td>
					In Normal mode, both button presses and releases are reported.
					The lower two bits of N indicate the button pressed:
					`00b` (0) left, `01b` (1) middle, `10b` (2) right, `11b` (3) button release.
					Wheel buttons are reported as 0 and 1 with added 64 (e.g. 64 and 65).
					Normal mode also supports tracking of modifier keys, which are added to N as bit masks:
					4=_Shift_, 8=_Meta/Alt_, 16=_Control/Cmd_. Example: middle button with _Shift_ = 1 + 4 = `101b` (5).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1002`</td>
				<td>*Button-Event tracking*</td>
				<td>
					This is similar to Normal mode (`1000`), but mouse motion with a button held is also reported.
					A motion event is generated when the mouse cursor moves between screen character cells.
					A motion event has the same N as a press event, but 32 is added.
					For example, drag-drop event with the middle button will produce N = 1 (press), 33 (dragging) and 3 (release).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1003`</td>
				<td>*Any-Event tracking*</td>
				<td>
					This mode is almost identical to Button Event tracking (1002), but motion events
					are sent even when no mouse buttons are held. This could be used to draw on-screen mouse cursor, for example.
					Motion events with no buttons will use N = 32 + _11b_ (35).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1004`</td>
				<td>*Focus~tracking*</td>
				<td>
					Focus tracking is a separate function from the other mouse tracking modes, therefore they can be enabled together.
					Focus tracking reports when the terminal window (in Xterm) gets or loses focus, or in ESPTerm's case, when any
					user is connected. This can be used to pause/resume a game or on-screen animations.
					Focus tracking mode sends `CSI I` when the terminal receives, and `CSI O` when it loses focus.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</div>

		<h4>Mouse Report Encoding</h4>

		<p>
			The following encoding schemes can be used with any of the tracking modes (except Focus tracking, which is not affected).
		</p>

		<div class="tscroll">
		<table class="nomen">
			<thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
			<tr>
				<td>--</td>
				<td>*Normal~encoding*</td>
				<td>
					This is the default encoding scheme used when no other option is selected.
					In this mode, a mouse report has the format `CSI M _n_ _x_ _y_`,
					where _n_, _x_ and _y_ are characters with ASCII value = 32 (space) + the respective number, e.g.
					0 becomes 32 (space), 1 becomes 33 (!). The reason for adding 32 is to avoid producing control characters.
					Example: `\e[M !!` - left button press at coordinates 1,1 when using X10 mode.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1005`</td>
				<td>*UTF-8~encoding*</td>
				<td>
					This scheme should encode each of the numbers as a UTF-8 code point, expanding the maximum possible value.
					Since ESPTerm's screen size is limited and this has no practical benefit, this serves simply as an alias
					to the normal scheme.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1006`</td>
				<td>*SGR~encoding*</td>
				<td>
					In SGR encoding, the response looks like a SGR sequence with the three numbers as semicolon-separated
					ASCII values. In this case 32 is not added like in the Normal and UTF-8 schemes, because
					it would serve nor purpose here. Also, button release is not reported as 11b,
					but using the normal button code while changing the final SGR character: `M` for button press
					and `m` for button release. Example: `\e[2;80;24m` - the right button was released
					at row 80, column 24.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>`1015`</td>
				<td>*URXVT~encoding*</td>
				<td>
					This is similar to SGR encoding, but the final character is always `M` and the numbers are
					like in the Normal scheme, with 32 added. This scheme has no real advantage over the previous schemes and
					was added solely for completeness.

	<h2>Alternate Character Sets</h2>

	<div class="Row v">
		<p>
			ESPTerm implements Alternate Character Sets as a way to print box drawing characters
			and special symbols. A character set can change what each received ASCII character
			is printed as on the screen (eg. "{" is "œÄ" in codepage `0`). The implementation is based
			on the original VT devices.
			Since ESPTerm also fully supports UTF-8, you can probably ignore this feature and use
			Unicode directly. It's added for compatibility with some programs that use this.
		</p>

		<p>The following codepages are implemented:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>`B` - US ASCII (default)</li>
			<li>`A` - UK ASCII: # replaced with ¬£</li>
			<li>`0` - Symbols and basic line drawing (standard DEC alternate character set)</li>
			<li>`1` - Symbols and advanced line drawing (based on DOS codepage 437)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>To see what character maps to which symbol, look in the source code or try it. All codepages use codes 32-127, 32 being space.</p>

		<p>
			There are two character set slots, G0 and G1.
			Those slots are selected as active using ASCII codes Shift In and Shift Out (those originally served for shifting
			a red-black typewriter tape). Each slot (G0 and G1) can have a different codepage assigned. G0 and G1 and the active slot number are
			saved and restored with the cursor and cleared with a screen reset (<code>\ec</code>).

			It's possible to dynamically change the screen title text and action button labels.
			Setting an empty label to a button makes it look disabled. The buttons send ASCII 1-5 when clicked.
			Those changes are not retained after restart.

					Query device status, ESPTerm replies with `\e[0n` "device is OK".

					This ASCII code is not a command, but is sent by ESPTerm when it becomes ready to receive commands.
					When this code is received on the UART, it means ESPTerm has restarted and is ready. Use this to detect
					spontaneous restarts which require a full screen repaint.
